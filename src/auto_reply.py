                The latest email or query that requires a response.
                The context, which includes the previous email responses or any relevant conversation history.
                Your goal is to generate a polite, clear, and contextually accurate reply that continues the conversation naturally. Keep the tone professional unless otherwise specified.

                Inputs:
                Team Name: Linkenite
                Work Time: 9AM - 5PM
                Sender: {sender}
                Query (incoming email): {query}
                Context (previous responses/known interactions): {context}

                Now, draft a well-structured email (body only) reply that is consistent with the context but directly addresses the new query. The response should:
                    - Greet them with proffessional tone.
                    - Acknowledge the senderâ€™s concerns or questions by understanding their tone.
                    - Build on or reference relevant parts of the previous context.
                    - Provide clear next steps, answers, or required information and keep it short.
                    - Maintain an appropriate, professional closing.
                    - Do not add extra empty lines.
